# 1 Objective
Analyze synthetic transaction data generated by the BankSim simulator to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities using Excel-based techniques.

# 2 About the Dataset
The dataset is derived from BankSim, a bank payment simulator based on aggregated transaction data from a Spanish bank. It includes both normal and fraudulent transactions over simulated time steps.

Total Records: 594,643
Normal Transactions: 587,443
Fraudulent Transactions: 7,200


# 3 Dataset Columns
Column	Description

step	Simulation step (time frame)
customer	Unique customer ID

age	Age group of the customer

gender	Customer's gender

merchant	Merchant where transaction occurs

category	Transaction category

amount	Transaction amount

fraud	0 (No Fraud) / 1 (Fraud)

# Analysis Steps in Excel
i Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and ensured data integrity.

ii Fraud Identification:
Applied filters and conditional formatting to highlight fraudulent transactions.


iii Pivot Tables:
Created pivot tables to summarize data by step, customer, merchant, and fraud status.


iv Visualization: Developed charts to visualize transaction trends, fraud distribution, and high-risk categories.

 v Insights:
Identified patterns such as frequent fraudulent transactions linked to specific merchants and age groups.

# Insights

i Fraud Distribution Overview:
Fraudulent Transactions: Account for just 1% of the total transactions, indicating a heavily imbalanced dataset.
Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 587,443
Fraudulent Transactions: 7,200

ii Age Group Analysis:
The highest counts in category 0 are for age groups 2 (184,966) and 3 (145,376).
There is a noticeable decline for age groups 4 and 5.
Fraudulent activities are concentrated in younger age groups (0, 1, 2).

iii Gender and Category Analysis:
In category 0, the "M" (265,950) and "F" (319,807) categories dominate.
Fraudulent transactions are significantly higher for the "F" (4,758) and "M" (2,435) categories compared to "E" (7) and "U" (0).

iv Merchant Insights:
43% of fraudulent transactions occur with merchants M480139044 and M980657600.
Category Insights:

v Top fraud categories include:
es_health: Total fraud amount of €664,804.39
es_sportsandtoys: Total fraud amount of €505,311.62
Interestingly, no fraudulent transactions occurred in the "es_transportation" category.

vi Transaction Amount Patterns:
Non-Fraudulent Transactions:
Average amounts are stable (31.4 - 32.1) across all step ranges.
These transactions remain low and consistent.

vii Fraudulent Transactions:
Average amounts are 10x to 18x higher than non-fraudulent transactions.

viii Peaks observed in specific step ranges:
25-49 steps: €588.5
100-124 steps: €615.6
Fraudulent amounts decline in later steps (e.g., 175-199 steps: €414.4).

xi Fraud Patterns by Steps:
Early Steps (0-74): High fraudulent activity, especially in steps 50-74.
Late Steps (175-199): Decline in fraud, indicating potential detection mechanisms.

x Key Takeaways:
Fraud detection should focus on:
Step ranges: 25-49, 50-74, and 100-124 where fraudulent activity peaks.
Younger age groups (0, 1, 2).
High-value transactions exceeding normal thresholds.

# Conclusion

Fraudulent transactions in this dataset display distinct patterns of high-value activity concentrated in early steps (0-74), especially between steps 25-49 and 50-74. Fraud is notably more frequent among younger age groups and involves specific merchants and categories like "es_health" and "es_sportsandtoys".

A robust fraud detection strategy should include:

Real-time monitoring during early steps.
Threshold-based alerts for high-value transactions.
Focus on younger demographics and peak fraud intervals to enhance detection efficiency and minimize losses.
